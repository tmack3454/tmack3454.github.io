	<h1> The Four Nations</h1>
	<p>The world is traditionally divided into four nations: the Water Tribe, Earth Kingdom, Fire Nation, and Air Nomads. Each nation is culturally unique and associated with one bending technique: waterbending, earthbending, firebending, and airbending, respectively. An even distribution of power among the four nations is believed to keep balance in the world, and a fall or increase in the strength of one nation can engender a disruptive imbalance.

    Despite these beliefs, the world's political and cultural landscape did not overlap with the Four Nations for most of history. The nations were instead split into multiple states,[nb 1] while people of the different nations often intermingled to form new cultures and ethnic groups.[</p>
